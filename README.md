cart-pole-nonlinear-control
===========================

Exploring the interesting aspects of nonlinear control using the famous test case of an inverted pendulum on a moving cart.

Balance: use LQR to design a state space feedback to balance the inverted pendulum by moving the cart only

Swing up: starting at the bottum, swing the pendulum to upright position and balance there, by moving the cart only

NOTE: to run the python codes, you need the following libraries: 1) numby   2) matplotlib   3) sicpy
